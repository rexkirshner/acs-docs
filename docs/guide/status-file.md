# STATUS.md - Current State

**Single source of truth for "what's happening now."** Fast orientation for session continuity and handoffs.

## Purpose

STATUS.md answers the critical question: **"What's the current state of this project?"**

It provides:
- **Quick Reference** - Auto-generated project overview
- **Current phase** - Where you are in development
- **Active tasks** - What's being worked on right now
- **Blockers** - What's preventing progress
- **Next session** - Clear starting point for resuming work

**Goal:** Any AI agent can read this file and be oriented in 2-3 minutes.

## When to Update

**Update STATUS.md:**
- ‚úÖ Every `/save` command (2-3 min, frequently)
- ‚úÖ Every `/save-full` command (10-15 min, before breaks)
- ‚úÖ When work in progress changes
- ‚úÖ When blockers appear or resolve
- ‚úÖ When moving to new development phase

**This file should always be current** - it's your safety net for session continuity.

### 4. Blockers & Decisions

**What's preventing progress:**

```markdown
## Blockers & Decisions Needed

### üöß Current Blockers

**BLOCKER-001: Webhook Retry Strategy**
- **Issue:** Stripe retries webhooks for up to 3 days
- **Impact:** Risk of duplicate order processing if not handled
- **Options:**
  - A) Process all retries (simple but risky)
  - B) Idempotency keys + deduplication (safer, more complex)
- **Blocking:** Order confirmation email (depends on webhook being reliable)
- **Decision needed:** Which approach to use?

### ‚è∞ Waiting On

**WAIT-001: Stripe Production Approval**
- Submitted: Oct 20
- Expected: Oct 27 (7 days)
- Impact: Can't deploy to production until approved
- Mitigation: Continue development in test mode

### ‚úÖ Recently Resolved

**RESOLVED-001: Payment Currency**
- Decision: USD only for MVP (Oct 22)
- Rationale: Simpler, most users in US
- International support in v2.0
```

**Why it matters:**
- Identifies what's blocking progress
- Documents decisions needed
- Shows what's waiting on external factors
- Tracks resolution of blockers

### 5. Recent Accomplishments

### 6. Next Session

**Where to start when you return:**

```markdown
## Next Session Start Point

**When you return, start here:**

1. **Read this STATUS.md** (you're doing it now! ‚úÖ)
2. **Check webhook handler progress:**
   - Review `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`
   - Test with Stripe CLI: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe`
   - Verify idempotency key checking works
3. **If webhook works, move to email:**
   - Trigger order confirmation email from webhook
   - Test email template rendering
   - Verify email delivery
4. **If stuck, see BLOCKER-001** (webhook retry strategy)

**Estimated session time:** 3-4 hours to complete webhook + email

**Context files to review:**
- DECISIONS.md: DEC-012 (Stripe integration approach)
- SESSIONS.md: Session 12 (webhook implementation details)
```

**Why it matters:**
- Zero orientation time
- Clear action items
- Immediate productivity
- No context loss

## Auto-Generated Quick Reference

The Quick Reference section is **automatically generated** by `/save` and `/save-full` commands.

### What Gets Extracted

**From `.context-config.json`:**
```json
{
  "project": {
    "name": "TaskFlow",
    "description": "Async task management for remote teams",
    "repository": "https://github.com/user/taskflow"
  },
  "techStack": {
    "frontend": "Next.js 14",
    "backend": "PostgreSQL",
    "infrastructure": "Vercel"
  },
  "urls": {
    "staging": "https://staging.taskflow.app",
    "production": "https://taskflow.app"
  }
}
```

**From STATUS.md itself:**
```markdown
## Current Phase
Phase: MVP Development

## Work In Progress
Current Focus: Payment integration with Stripe
```

**Result:**
```markdown
## üìä Quick Reference
**Project:** TaskFlow - Async task management for remote teams
**Phase:** MVP Development
**Status:** üü¢ Active
**Current Focus:** Payment integration with Stripe
**Tech Stack:** Next.js 14, PostgreSQL, Vercel
```

### How It Works

1. `/save` or `/save-full` runs
2. `scripts/update-quick-reference.sh` executes
3. Reads `.context-config.json`
4. Parses STATUS.md for current phase/focus
5. Links to latest SESSIONS.md entry
6. Generates formatted Quick Reference
7. Updates STATUS.md in place

**You never manually edit Quick Reference** - it's always current.

## Blockers & Decisions

### üöß Active Blockers

**BLOCKER-001: Webhook Retry Strategy**
- **Issue:** Stripe retries failed webhooks for up to 3 days
- **Risk:** Duplicate order processing if webhook fires multiple times
- **Impact:** Blocking order confirmation email (need reliable webhook)
- **Options:**
  - A) Process all retries blindly (risky - could duplicate orders)
  - B) Check idempotency key + order status before processing (safer)
  - C) Use Stripe's idempotency guarantees + our own dedup (recommended)
- **Decision needed:** Which approach? Leaning toward C.
- **Research done:** Stripe docs, best practices articles
- **Timeline:** Need decision today to proceed with email

### ‚è∞ Waiting On

**WAIT-001: Stripe Production Account Approval**
- **Submitted:** Oct 20, 2025
- **Expected:** Oct 27, 2025 (7 business days)
- **Impact:** Cannot deploy to production
- **Mitigation:** Continue development in test mode
- **Fallback:** Manual approval request if delayed

### ‚úÖ Recently Resolved

**RESOLVED-001: Payment Currency Support**
- **Resolved:** Oct 22, 2025
- **Decision:** USD only for MVP
- **Rationale:** 95% of beta users in US, simpler implementation
- **Future:** Multi-currency in v2.0
- **Documented:** DECISIONS.md DEC-012

## Next Session Start Point

**When you return:**

1. ‚úÖ **Read STATUS.md** (you're here!)
2. **Check webhook handler:**
   - File: `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`
   - Run Stripe CLI: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe`
   - Test payment flow: create test order, trigger webhook
   - Verify idempotency key prevents duplicates
3. **Resolve BLOCKER-001:**

   - Implement chosen retry strategy
   - Write test cases for duplicate webhooks
4. **Move to order email:**
   - Trigger SendGrid from webhook
   - Test template rendering
   - Verify delivery

**Estimated time:** 3-4 hours to complete webhook + email

**If stuck:**
- Review DECISIONS.md DEC-012 (Stripe integration rationale)
- Check SESSIONS.md Session 12 (webhook implementation notes)
- Stripe docs: https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks/best-practices

**Success criteria:**
- Webhook handles successful payments reliably
- No duplicate orders from retries
- Email sent immediately after payment
- Order status updates correctly

---

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-23 15:30 (Session 12)
**Next Review:** After webhook handler completion
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Update Frequently

```bash
# Every 30-60 minutes during active work
/save

# Before any break (lunch, end of day, context switch)
/save-full
```

**Why:** STATUS.md should always reflect current reality.

### 2. Be Specific in Work In Progress

```markdown
# Too vague:
- Working on webhooks

# Better:
- Implementing payment_intent.succeeded webhook handler
- Using idempotency keys for duplicate prevention
- Testing with Stripe CLI
- ETA: 2 days
```

### 3. Document Blockers Thoroughly

```markdown
# Include:
- What's blocked
- Why it's blocked
- Impact (what can't proceed)
- Options being considered
- Decision timeline
- Who needs to decide
```

### 4. Keep Next Session Actionable

```markdown
# Not helpful:
"Continue working on payments"

# Helpful:
"Test webhook with Stripe CLI:
 stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
 Then verify idempotency key checking in route.ts"
```

### 5. Trust Auto-Generation

```markdown
# Don't manually edit Quick Reference
# Let /save and /save-full handle it
# Update .context-config.json if base info changes
```

## Integration with Other Files

**STATUS.md works with:**

- **CONTEXT.md** - References project overview (doesn't duplicate)
- **DECISIONS.md** - Links to relevant decisions (e.g., "See DEC-012")
- **SESSIONS.md** - Links to recent sessions for detailed history
- **.context-config.json** - Source data for auto-generated Quick Reference

**Flow:**
1. Work happens
2. `/save` updates STATUS.md + regenerates Quick Reference
3. `/save-full` also adds SESSIONS.md entry
4. STATUS.md always shows "now"
5. SESSIONS.md preserves history

## Success Metric

> **"I can read STATUS.md and know exactly what's happening, what's blocking progress, and where to start‚Äîin under 3 minutes."**

When this is true, STATUS.md is effective.

## Next Steps

- [DECISIONS.md Guide](/guide/decisions-file) - Document decision rationale
- [SESSIONS.md Guide](/guide/sessions-file) - Session history
- [/save Command](/commands/save) - Quick STATUS.md updates
- [/save-full Command](/commands/save-full) - Comprehensive updates with sessions
