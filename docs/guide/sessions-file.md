# SESSIONS.md - Session History

**What happened when.** Chronicles project evolution with AI mental models, decision-making processes, and problem-solving approaches.

## Purpose

SESSIONS.md answers: **"How did this project evolve? What did we learn along the way?"**

It documents:
- **Session timeline** - Chronological development history
- **AI mental models** - What AI understood at each point
- **Problem-solving approaches** - How challenges were tackled
- **Decisions made** - What was decided in each session
- **Files changed** - What code was modified
- **Git operations** - Commits and pushes (auto-logged)

**Goal:** Complete project history that enables session continuity, AI handoffs, and learning from past work.

## Why This Matters

### For Session Continuity

**Problem:** AI forgets what happened in previous sessions.

**Solution:** Read last session entry to restore context.

**Example:**
```markdown
## Session 12 | 2025-10-23 | Stripe Webhook Implementation

**Mental Models:**
- Webhook receives payment_intent.succeeded from Stripe
- Need idempotency keys to prevent duplicate processing
- Database transaction updates order status (pending → confirmed)
- Redis caches order for fast lookup
```

**Result:** Next session reads this, AI knows exactly where things left off.

### For AI-to-AI Handoffs

**Problem:** New AI agent doesn't know project history.

**Solution:** Read SESSIONS.md chronologically to understand evolution.

**Example:**
New AI reads:
- Session 1: Initial setup, chose Next.js
- Session 5: Added authentication, chose JWT
- Session 10: Integrated payments, chose Stripe
- Session 15: Optimized database, added indexes

**Result:** New AI understands full context, makes consistent decisions.

### For Human Review

**Problem:** Humans want to understand AI's thought process.

**Solution:** Read mental models and problem-solving approach.

**Example:**
```markdown
### Problem-Solving Approach

**Challenge:** N+1 query problem causing slow /api/projects endpoint (1.2s)

**Investigation:**
1. Added query logging → discovered 100+ SELECT queries per request
2. Identified: fetching tasks individually for each project
3. Root cause: Missing eager loading in Prisma query

**Solution Explored:**
- Option A: Add .include({ tasks: true }) (simple but loads all task data)
- Option B: Separate query with IN clause (more control)
- Option C: DataLoader pattern (complex, overkill for our scale)

**Implemented:** Option A with select to limit fields
**Result:** 1.2s → 120ms (10x improvement)
**Tradeoff:** More memory per request, but acceptable at current scale
```

**Result:** Human understands exactly how AI solved the problem.

### For Learning from History

**Problem:** Make same mistakes repeatedly.

**Solution:** Review past sessions to learn patterns.

**Example:**
Reading Session 8:
```markdown
**Mistakes Made:**
- Assumed API would return array, actually returns object
- Spent 30 minutes debugging before checking API docs
- **Lesson:** Always verify API response shape with actual call first
```

**Result:** Future work checks API responses upfront.

## Real-World Example

Complete session entry:

```markdown
## Session 12 | 2025-10-23 | Stripe Webhook Handler Implementation

**Duration:** 4h | **Focus:** Implement payment confirmation webhook | **Status:** ✅ Complete

### TL;DR

Implemented Stripe webhook handler for payment_intent.succeeded events. Added idempotency key checking to prevent duplicate order processing. Tested with Stripe CLI, confirmed webhook updates order status correctly. Ready for order confirmation email implementation.

### Session Goals

- [x] Create webhook endpoint route
- [x] Implement idempotency key checking
- [x] Add database transaction for order status update
- [x] Test with Stripe CLI
- [ ] Implement order confirmation email (moved to Session 13)

### Mental Models

**Current understanding:**
- Stripe sends payment_intent.succeeded webhook after successful payment
- Webhooks can fire multiple times (retries for up to 3 days)
- Idempotency keys prevent duplicate processing
- Order status flow: pending → processing → confirmed
- Database transaction ensures atomicity

**Architecture understanding:**
```
[Stripe] --webhook--> [/api/webhooks/stripe]
                             ↓
                      [Verify signature]
                             ↓
                      [Check idempotency]
                             ↓
                      [Update order in DB]
                             ↓
                      [Cache invalidation]
```

**Technical approach:**
- Express route: POST /api/webhooks/stripe
- Stripe webhook signature verification (crypto.verify)
- Idempotency table: webhook_event_id → processed_at
- Order update: BEGIN TRANSACTION → UPDATE → COMMIT
- Redis: delete cached order on status change

**Known constraints:**
- Stripe retries failed webhooks (exponential backoff, 3 days max)
- Webhook signature expires after 300 seconds
- Idempotency key: Stripe's event ID (unique per event)
- Database transaction prevents partial updates

**Unknowns/Assumptions:**
- ✅ **Verified:** Stripe event IDs are globally unique (confirmed in docs)
- ✅ **Verified:** Signature verification prevents replay attacks
- 🔮 **Assuming:** Order confirmation email will be fast enough (<5s)
- ⚠️ **Need to verify:** What happens if email send fails? (Next session)

### What Changed

**Features Implemented:**

**Stripe Webhook Handler**
- Created POST /api/webhooks/stripe endpoint
- Verifies webhook signature using Stripe library
- Extracts payment_intent data from event
- Updates order status in database transaction
- Returns 200 OK to acknowledge receipt

**Idempotency System**
- Created webhook_events table (event_id, processed_at, order_id)
- Check: if event_id exists, return 200 (already processed)
- Insert event_id before processing (prevents race conditions)
- Unique index on event_id (database-level deduplication)

**Order Status Update**
- Database transaction: BEGIN → UPDATE orders → INSERT webhook_event → COMMIT
- Status: pending → confirmed
- confirmed_at timestamp set
- Redis cache invalidated for affected order

**Testing Infrastructure**
- Stripe CLI webhook forwarding setup
- Test script: creates test payment, triggers webhook
- Verified idempotency (re-sending same event = no duplicate)

**Bugs Fixed:**
- None (first implementation, no pre-existing bugs)

**Refactoring:**
- Extracted signature verification to middleware
- Created OrderService.confirmOrder() method (business logic separation)

### Decisions Made

- **DEC-014:** Use Stripe event ID as idempotency key
  - Rationale: Globally unique, provided by Stripe, perfect for deduplication
  - See DECISIONS.md for full details

- **DEC-015:** Store idempotency in database, not Redis
  - Rationale: Need persistence across restarts, Redis cache might evict
  - Tradeoff: Extra DB write, but worth reliability
  - See DECISIONS.md for full details

### Problem-Solving Approach

**Challenge 1: Preventing Duplicate Order Processing**

**Investigation:**
- Read Stripe docs on webhook retries
- Discovered: webhooks can fire multiple times (network issues, timeouts)
- Risk: Same order confirmed twice = customer charged once, order recorded twice
- Need idempotency to handle retries safely

**Solution Explored:**
- Option A: Check order status before updating (race condition risk)
- Option B: Use Stripe event ID as idempotency key (recommended by Stripe)
- Option C: Generate our own idempotency key (unnecessary complexity)

**Implemented:** Option B (Stripe event ID)
- Created webhook_events table with unique index on event_id
- Insert event_id BEFORE processing (fails if duplicate)
- If insert fails → already processed → return 200 OK
- If insert succeeds → process event → update order

**Result:** Duplicate webhooks handled safely, no duplicate orders

**Validation:**
- Tested: Send same webhook twice via Stripe CLI
- First request: Order confirmed, webhook logged
- Second request: Returns 200 but no order update
- ✅ Confirmed: Idempotency works

**Challenge 2: Webhook Signature Verification**

**Investigation:**
- Stripe sends signature in Stripe-Signature header
- Need to verify webhook came from Stripe (not attacker)
- Signature = HMAC of payload + timestamp + webhook secret

**Solution:**
- Use Stripe library: stripe.webhooks.constructEvent()
- Automatically verifies signature + checks timestamp freshness
- Throws error if signature invalid or >5 min old

**Implemented:**
```typescript
const sig = req.headers['stripe-signature'];
const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
  req.body,
  sig,
  process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
);
```

**Result:** Only valid Stripe webhooks processed

**Lessons Learned:**
- Always use Stripe's library (don't manually verify signatures)
- Raw body needed for verification (not JSON-parsed)
- Test with Stripe CLI before production
- Idempotency at database level (not application level) = more reliable

### Files Changed

**Created:**
- `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` - Webhook endpoint handler
- `lib/services/OrderService.ts` - Order business logic
- `prisma/migrations/XXX_create_webhook_events.sql` - Idempotency table
- `tests/webhooks/stripe.test.ts` - Webhook handler tests

**Modified:**
- `app/api/checkout/route.ts` - Added webhook URL to checkout session
- `lib/db/schema.prisma` - Added webhook_events model
- `.env.example` - Added STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
- `next.config.js` - Disabled bodyParser for webhook route

**Deleted:**
- None

### Git Operations

**Commits:**
- `a1b2c3d` - Add Stripe webhook route with signature verification
- `e4f5g6h` - Implement idempotency checking with database
- `i7j8k9l` - Add order status update transaction
- `m0n1o2p` - Add webhook handler tests

**Pushed:** origin/main (4 commits)

### Next Session

**Start here:**
1. **Implement order confirmation email**
   - Trigger from webhook after order confirmed
   - Use SendGrid template (already created)
   - Include: order details, receipt, tracking number (if available)
   - Handle email send failures gracefully

2. **If email works, move to:**
   - End-to-end testing (full checkout flow)
   - Verify email delivery
   - Test error cases (failed payment, timeout)

3. **If blocked:**
   - Review BLOCKER-001 in STATUS.md (email send failure handling)
   - Consider: Retry logic, dead letter queue, or log + alert

**Context to review:**
- SendGrid template: `templates/order-confirmation.html`
- Order model: `lib/db/schema.prisma` (Order type)
- DEC-014, DEC-015 in DECISIONS.md

**Estimated next session:** 2-3 hours for email implementation

**Session completed:** 2025-10-23 18:00
**Time elapsed:** 4 hours (started 14:00)
**Energy level:** High (productive session, clear progress)
**Blockers encountered:** None
```

## Auto-Logged Git Operations

The `/save-full` command automatically logs git operations:

```markdown
### Git Operations

**Commits since last session:**
- `a1b2c3d` - Add Stripe webhook route
- `e4f5g6h` - Implement idempotency checking
- `i7j8k9l` - Add order status update
- `m0n1o2p` - Add webhook tests

**Branches:**
- Working on: feature/stripe-webhooks
- Base: main

**Push status:** Pushed to origin/main (4 commits)

**Changed files:** (extracted from commits)
- app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts (created)
- lib/services/OrderService.ts (created)
- prisma/schema.prisma (modified)
- tests/webhooks/stripe.test.ts (created)
```

**How it works:**
1. `/save-full` runs
2. Executes `git log --since="last session"`
3. Extracts commit messages and hashes
4. Checks push status
5. Adds to SESSIONS.md automatically

**You never manually log git operations** - they're captured automatically.

## Session Templates

The system provides session templates to ensure consistency.

### Created by /save-full

When you run `/save-full`, the helper script creates a draft session entry:

```bash
/save-full

# Creates draft in SESSIONS.md:
## Session 13 | 2025-10-24 | [AI suggests title based on recent work]

**Duration:** [Auto-calculated from last session]
**Focus:** [Extracted from STATUS.md current work]
**Status:** 🔄 In Progress

### TL;DR
[AI generates based on git commits and file changes]

### Mental Models
[AI documents current understanding]

# ... rest of template filled out by AI
```

### Manual Session Entries

For other AI tools (non-Claude Code), reference template:

```
templates/session-template.md
```

Follow structure manually when updating SESSIONS.md.

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Include TL;DR

```markdown
# Not helpful:
## Session 5 | Work on payments

# Helpful:
## Session 5 | 2025-10-20 | Stripe Integration Setup

**TL;DR:** Integrated Stripe SDK, created checkout flow,
added payment intent creation. Tested with test cards,
confirmed charges work. Ready for webhook implementation.
```

### 2. Document Mental Models Honestly

```markdown
# Be explicit about understanding:
**Mental Models:**
- ✅ Understand: JWT token flow, refresh mechanism
- ✅ Understand: Database schema, relationships
- ❓ Unclear: Rate limiting implementation (need to research)
- ⚠️ Assumption: Users want email notifications (verify with user)
```

### 3. Capture Problem-Solving Process

```markdown
# Not just solution, but HOW you got there:
**Challenge:** API returning 500 errors

**Investigation:**
1. Checked logs → no error details
2. Added error logging middleware → saw database timeout
3. Checked DB connections → connection pool exhausted
4. Root cause: Missing connection.release() in API routes

**Solution:** Added connection release in finally block
**Result:** No more 500 errors, connection pool stable
```

### 4. Link to Decisions

```markdown
### Decisions Made

- **DEC-008:** Use Redis for caching (see DECISIONS.md)
- **DEC-009:** Continuous deployment to staging (see DECISIONS.md)

# Don't duplicate decision content
# Reference DECISIONS.md for full rationale
```

### 5. Make "Next Session" Actionable

```markdown
# Vague:
**Next Session:** Continue working on auth

# Specific:
**Next Session:**
1. Implement password reset flow
   - Email template: templates/password-reset.html
   - Route: POST /api/auth/reset-password
   - Test: Reset token expiration (30 min)
2. If blocked, review DEC-007 (email service choice)
```

### 6. Review Before Session End

```bash
# Before finishing session:
/save-full

# AI generates session entry
# THEN: Review for accuracy
# - Mental models correct?
# - Problem-solving captured?
# - Next session clear?

# Make manual edits if needed
# This is YOUR history, make it useful
```

## Success Metrics

> **"I can read the last 3 session entries and understand exactly how the project evolved and what the AI was thinking."**

> **"A new AI agent can read SESSIONS.md and feel like it was there from the beginning."**

When these are true, SESSIONS.md is effective.
