## Core Philosophy

AI reasoning is invisible. Context is lost between sessions. Decisions lack rationale. Humans can't review AI's thinking.

**The solution:** Externalize AI context into structured, visible documentation that serves four purposes:

1. **Session Continuity** - Pick up exactly where you left off
2. **Externalized Context** - Make AI reasoning visible to humans
3. **Human-AI Collaboration** - Full visibility into AI thinking
4. **AI-to-AI Collaboration** - Perfect handoffs and peer review

## Current Version

**v5.1.4** - Library Adoption Reviewer

New specialist agent for identifying homegrown code that could be replaced with battle-tested libraries:

- **Library adoption reviewer** - New agent detecting reinvented wheels (date utils, validation, HTTP clients)
- **`/code-review --libraries`** - New flag for library adoption review
- **14 specialist agents** - 9 review domains + 5 support agents
- **80 tests passing** - All unit tests pass across 11 modules

**v5.1.3** fixed session statistics in `/review-context` and CHANGELOG reference in install script.

**v5.1.2** fixed nested repo detection and Claude Code settings conflict.

**v5.1.1** fixed shell compatibility bugs (macOS grep, parent detection, zsh output).
