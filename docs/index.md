## Core Philosophy

AI reasoning is invisible. Context is lost between sessions. Decisions lack rationale. Humans can't review AI's thinking.

**The solution:** Externalize AI context into structured, visible documentation that serves four purposes:

1. **Session Continuity** - Pick up exactly where you left off
2. **Externalized Context** - Make AI reasoning visible to humans
3. **Human-AI Collaboration** - Full visibility into AI thinking
4. **AI-to-AI Collaboration** - Perfect handoffs and peer review

## Current Version

**v5.1.0** - Finding Deduplication & Enhanced Security

Major release building on the agent-based architecture with intelligent finding synthesis:

- **Finding Deduplication** - Intelligent synthesis combining overlapping findings across reviewers
- **Decision-Aware Review** - Code review considers DECISIONS.md for architectural context
- **Synthesis Agent** - Automated finding combination with source attribution
- **Upgrade Protection** - Idempotent upgrade paths with automatic backup/rollback
- **Monorepo Support** - Multi-project configurations with shared context
- **Hook Security** - Enhanced permission model for session automation
- **Shell Compatibility** - Full support for bash, zsh, and sh across macOS and Linux
- **203+ tests passing** - Comprehensive coverage including install, hooks, shell compatibility, and cross-platform

**v5.0** introduced agent-based code review with 12 specialist agents and self-declaring contracts.
