## Core Philosophy

AI reasoning is invisible. Context is lost between sessions. Decisions lack rationale. Humans can't review AI's thinking.

**The solution:** Externalize AI context into structured, visible documentation that serves four purposes:

1. **Session Continuity** - Pick up exactly where you left off
2. **Externalized Context** - Make AI reasoning visible to humans
3. **Human-AI Collaboration** - Full visibility into AI thinking
4. **AI-to-AI Collaboration** - Perfect handoffs and peer review

## Current Version

**v3.2.2** - Production Ready
